## üîê PATENT PENDING - PROTECTED INNOVATION
**U.S. Patent Application No. 63/839,719**  
**Filed:** July 7, 2025  
**Title:** "Wave-Based Synthetic Micro Intelligence System and Method"  
**Status:** PATENT PENDING - All Rights Reserved

 **PATENT PROTECTION NOTICE:** Pending U.S. patent applications protect this technology.

## Summary
A deterministic, wave-based cognitive engine offering orders-of-magnitude improvements in speed, size, and energy efficiency over transformer-based LLMs for logical and symbolic reasoning. Designed for edge, remote, and sensitive computing environments where resource constraints and interpretability are paramount.

## Key Metrics: LLM vs. Wave Engine

| Metric                | Transformer LLM (LLaMA 3.2 1B) | Wave Engine (Atlan) |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| Inference Time       | ~24.5s                        | ~0.008s             |
| Model Size           | ~1.3GB                        | ~104KB              |
| Energy Use           | 100‚Äì300W (GPU)                | <1W (CPU)           |
| Memory Usage         | 4‚Äì8GB RAM                     | <1MB                |
| Reasoning Basis      | Probabilistic                 | Deterministic, Symbolic |
| Output Nature        | Stochastic, Generative        | Deterministic, Symbolic |
| Accuracy (LogicBench)| 69%                           | 65.9%               |

## How It Works
The Wave Engine encodes symbols as unique frequencies and computes semantic relationships via constructive and destructive interference patterns. This deterministic process enables:
- Direct symbolic grounding (frequency-symbol bijection)
- Interpretable, reproducible reasoning
- Ultra-low resource requirements
