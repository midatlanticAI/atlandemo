## Atlan Symbolic Cognitive Engine

A comprehensive framework for symbolic memory, perception, reasoning, and reflection designed to create adaptive AI agents with emergent personality and belief systems.

## Overview

The Atlan Symbolic Cognitive Engine is a sophisticated AI architecture that combines multiple cognitive components to create agents capable of:

- **Symbolic Memory Management**: Efficient storage and retrieval of experiences with reinforcement learning
- **Emotional Perception**: Sentiment analysis and mood tracking with drift detection
- **Belief System Evolution**: Dynamic belief revision based on experience and feedback
- **Narrative Construction**: Personality development through mood pattern analysis
- **Self-Reflection**: Autonomous belief updating and state assessment

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **AtlanAgent** (`agent.py`) - Main orchestrator that coordinates all cognitive components
2. **RCoreMemoryIndex** (`memory.py`) - Indexed memory system with symbolic nodes and reinforcement
3. **ToneEngine & DriftTracker** (`perception.py`) - Sentiment analysis and emotional state tracking
4. **BeliefSystem & DreamspaceSimulator** (`reasoning.py`) - Belief management and action simulation
5. **SelfAnchor** (`reflection.py`) - Self-reflection and belief revision mechanisms
6. **NarrativeNode** (`narrative.py`) - Personality development and narrative construction
7. **ReinforcementEngine** (`reinforcement.py`) - Memory strengthening and decay management
8. **Similarity Functions** (`similarity.py`) - Vector similarity and resonance calculations
9. **Utilities** (`utils.py`) - Vector encoding and helper functions

### Key Features

- **Memory Reinforcement**: Memories strengthen with repeated access and weaken over time
- **Emotional Drift Tracking**: Monitors mood changes and volatility patterns
- **Belief Evolution**: Beliefs adapt based on action outcomes and feedback
- **Personality Emergence**: Personality traits develop from behavioral patterns
- **Action Simulation**: Dreamspace simulates potential outcomes before action selection
- **Self-Reflection Cycles**: Periodic belief revision and state assessment

## Installation

```bash
# Clone or extract the VTRFM source code
cd atlandemo

# Install dependencies (optional, uses only Python standard library)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Basic Agent Creation

```python
from src import AtlanAgent

# Create an agent with default configuration
agent = AtlanAgent(agent_id="my_agent")

# Create an agent with custom configuration
config = {
    'memory': {'max_size': 2000},
    'drift_window': 50,
    'match_threshold': 0.9,
    'initial_beliefs': {
        'exploration_is_valuable': 0.8,
        'caution_prevents_mistakes': 0.6
    }
}
agent = AtlanAgent(agent_id="custom_agent", config=config)
```

### Processing Input and Learning

```python
# Process input phrases
result = agent.process_input("I feel great about this project!", label="positive_feedback")
print(f"Mood score: {result['mood_score']}")
print(f"Memory status: {result['memory_interaction']['status']}")

# Choose actions based on current state
action = agent.choose_action()
print(f"Chosen action: {action}")

# Record outcomes to update beliefs
feedback = agent.record_outcome(action, actual_outcome=0.7)
print(f"Feedback: {feedback['feedback']}")
```

### Self-Reflection and State Monitoring

```python
# Trigger self-reflection
reflection = agent.reflect()
print(f"Belief revisions: {reflection['belief_revisions']}")

# Get current agent state
state = agent.get_state(include_memory_sample=5)
print(f"Current personality: {state['personality']}")
print(f"Memory stats: {state['memory_stats']}")

# Get tone-appropriate response template
template = agent.get_response_template()
print(f"Response template: {template}")
```

### State Persistence

```python
# Save agent state
agent.save_state("agent_state.json")

# Load agent state (implementation needs completion)
agent.load_state("agent_state.json")
```

## Configuration Options

The agent accepts a configuration dictionary with the following options:

```python
config = {
    'memory': {
        'max_size': 1000,              # Maximum memory nodes
        'decay_threshold': 0.2,        # Minimum reinforcement before decay
        'retention_window': 604800,    # Retention time in seconds (7 days)
        'reinforcement_weight': 0.05   # Weight of reinforcement in similarity
    },
    'drift_window': 30,                # Mood history window size
    'match_threshold': 0.95,           # Similarity threshold for memory matching
    'initial_beliefs': {               # Starting beliefs and confidence levels
        'custom_belief': 0.7
    },
    'action_effects': {                # Action outcome templates
        'custom_action': 0.3
    }
}
```

## Testing

```bash
# Run basic functionality tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test modules
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_agent.py -v
```

## Architecture Principles

### Symbolic Representation
- All experiences are encoded as symbolic vectors with semantic meaning
- Memory nodes contain both content and metadata for rich retrieval
- Similarity calculations combine multiple vector metrics

### Reinforcement Learning
- Memories strengthen with repeated access and successful outcomes
- Weak memories decay over time to prevent information overload
- Belief confidence adjusts based on action feedback

### Emergent Behavior
- Personality traits emerge from behavioral patterns over time
- Beliefs evolve through experience rather than explicit programming
- Emotional states influence decision-making and memory formation

### Self-Awareness
- Agents monitor their own internal states and patterns
- Reflection cycles trigger belief revision and adaptation
- Narrative construction provides coherent self-understanding

## Security Considerations

- Input validation prevents malformed data from corrupting agent state
- Memory pruning prevents unbounded growth and resource exhaustion
- Belief revision has safeguards against rapid oscillation
- State serialization should be validated when loading from external sources

## Performance Optimization

- Memory indexing provides O(1) hash-based retrieval
- Caching reduces redundant similarity calculations
- Configurable memory limits prevent resource exhaustion
- Efficient vector operations minimize computational overhead

## Future Enhancements

- Multi-agent communication and belief sharing
- Enhanced natural language processing integration
- Persistent storage backends (database integration)
- Distributed memory and processing capabilities
- Advanced personality modeling and social dynamics
