# Addendum – Quantitative Affective Encoding in the Atlan Temporal‐Resonant Cognition Engine  
Date: 16 Jul 2025 (claims priority to provisional filed 07 Jul 2025)

---

## 1  Scope of Addendum
This document extends the original patent disclosure “Temporal Resonance Memory System and Symbolic Node Network” (filed 07 Jul 2025) by detailing the newly-implemented mechanism for **quantitative emotional resonance** within the Atlan Wave-Engine.  The addendum should be read as an integral part of the original specification; section and claim numbering continue accordingly.

## 2  Technical Field (CPC G06N-20/00)
The disclosure relates to non-neural symbolic artificial-intelligence systems employing oscillatory interference patterns to perform reasoning and to encode affective state variables.

## 3  Background
Qualitative affect (positive/negative valence) was previously demonstrated via phase polarity.  Quantitative strength of emotion (magnitude of valence and arousal) had not been demonstrably encoded.  The present addendum documents the successful integration of *time-averaged band-specific energy variables* yielding high-fidelity quantitative affect.

## 4  Summary of Improvements
1. **Frequency-Band Segregation** – Dedicated theta-band (≈6 Hz) and gamma-band (≈40 Hz) carrier waves inject emotional polarity and arousal, respectively, without interfering with beta-band logic waves.
2. **Magnitude Channels** – Quasi-DC symbols (`valence_mag`, `arousal_mag`) propagate absolute mood and arousal magnitudes.
3. **Rolling Integration Window** – A 20-frame (~1 s) moving average produces slow-varying integrated variables (`valence_integrated`, `arousal_integrated`).
4. **API Exposure** – Method `get_emotion_state()` returns the current integrated affect for use by expert modules and external applications.

## 5  Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment
### 5.1  Wave Injection Equations
Let `m ∈ [−1,1]` be mood (valence), `a ∈ [0,1]` be arousal, and `t` continuous time.

| Wave | Frequency | Amplitude | Phase |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Valence marker | `f_v = 6 Hz` | `A_v = |m|` | `0` if `m>0`, `π` if `m<0` |
| Arousal marker | `f_a = 40 Hz` | `A_a = a` | `0` |
| Valence magnitude | `f≈0 Hz` | `|m|` | `π⁄2` |
| Arousal magnitude | `f≈0 Hz` | `a` | `π⁄2` |

### 5.2  Temporal Integration
For each frame `k` with period Δt≈50 ms, the engine appends `m_k, a_k` to fixed-length deques (`N=20`).

Integrated variables:
\[
\bar m_k = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=k-N+1}^{k} m_i,\quad
\bar a_k = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=k-N+1}^{k} a_i
\]

These correspond to a rectangular low-pass filter with cutoff ≈1 Hz, matching psychophysical affect buildup times.

### 5.3  Public Interface
```python
state = engine.get_emotion_state()
# → {"valence": 0.73, "arousal": 0.52}
```
Values are re-computed each frame and may be logged, fed to UI layers, or used for action selection.

## 6  Experimental Validation
A synthetic benchmark (500 randomised emotion frames) produced the following Pearson correlations:

| Variable | r | p-value |
|----------|----|---------|
| Instantaneous valence | 0.26 | <10⁻⁵ |
| Instantaneous arousal | 0.09 | n.s. |
| **Integrated valence** | **0.93** | <10⁻⁸⁰ |
| **Integrated arousal** | **0.90** | <10⁻⁷⁰ |

Phase-cancellation and mood-drift tests from the original disclosure remain satisfied.

## 7  Advantages over Prior Art
1. Encodes both **symbolic logic** and **quantitative affect** without gradient descent.
2. Emotion variables emerge from **energy integration**, analogous to EEG band-power, rather than static tags.
3. Fully deterministic; parameters derive from explicit equations, improving explainability.

## 8  Claims (Additions)
**Claim 16** (dependent on Claim 5) – The system of Claim 5 wherein emotional valence magnitude is represented by the running mean of phase-polarised theta-band carrier amplitude measured over at least 20 successive experience frames.

**Claim 17** – The system of Claim 16 wherein arousal magnitude is represented by the running mean of gamma-band carrier amplitude measured over the same window.

**Claim 18** – The system of Claim 16 further comprising a quasi-DC symbolic node whose activation amplitude equals the computed valence magnitude, thereby allowing downstream modules to access quantitative valence directly.

## 9  Industrial Applicability
Applicable to real-time human–AI interaction systems, embodied robotics requiring affective feedback, and adaptive tutoring platforms where resonant emotional state guides pedagogical strategy.
