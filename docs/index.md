# Wave Engine Documentation

Welcome to the Wave Engine - a revolutionary AI cognition system based on wave mechanics.

## Overview

The Wave Engine represents a paradigm shift in AI cognition, modeling thought processes as intersecting waves rather than traditional symbolic computation. This approach enables:

- **Temporal Cognition**: Experience flows as continuous waves over time
- **Resonant Associations**: Concepts interfere and resonate to create emergent meaning
- **Contextual Understanding**: Dynamic activation fields adapt to changing contexts
- **Efficient Processing**: Lightweight wave mechanics for real-time performance

## Features

- **Wave-based Cognition**: Revolutionary approach to AI reasoning
- **High Performance**: Optimized for speed and efficiency
- **Multi-domain Expertise**: Logic, mathematics, language processing
- **Modular Architecture**: Extensible expert module system
- **Benchmark Performance**: Competitive results on LogicBench and other tasks

## Quick Start

```python
from enhanced_wave_engine import EnhancedWaveEngine

# Create wave engine
engine = EnhancedWaveEngine()

# Process a query
result = engine.process_query("What is the meaning of life?")
print(result.answer)
```

## Architecture

The Wave Engine consists of several key components:

- **Temporal Cognition Engine**: Core wave mechanics and interference patterns
- **Expert Module Registry**: Specialized processing modules for different domains
- **Memory System**: Persistent storage and retrieval of wave patterns
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Adaptive optimization of wave parameters

## Performance

The Wave Engine demonstrates competitive performance on various benchmarks:

- **LogicBench**: 69%+ accuracy on logical reasoning tasks
- **Response Time**: Sub-second processing for most queries
- **Memory Footprint**: Lightweight compared to traditional LLMs
- **Scalability**: Efficient scaling across multiple domains
