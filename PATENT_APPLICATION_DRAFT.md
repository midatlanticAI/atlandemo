## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

### Core Wave Generation Algorithm

The fundamental innovation converts symbolic inputs into wave patterns using the following mathematical transformation:

```
For each symbol S:
frequency(S) = 1.0 + (hash(S) % 100) / 100.0
amplitude(S) = 0.5 + (length(S) % 10) / 20.0  
phase(S) = (hash(S) % 628) / 100.0
wave_value(S,t) = amplitude(S) * sin(2π * frequency(S) * t + phase(S))
```

Where:
- `hash(S)` is a deterministic hash function applied to symbol S
- `length(S)` is the character length of symbol S
- `t` is the current time parameter

### Wave Interference Calculation

The system determines logical relationships through wave interference patterns:

```
For waves W1 and W2:
phase_difference = |phase(W1) - phase(W2)| % (2π)

If phase_difference < π/4:
    interference = constructive (W1 + W2)
Else if phase_difference > 3π/4:
    interference = destructive (|W1 - W2|)
Else:
    interference = harmonic (W1 * W2)
```

### Temporal Cognition Engine

The system maintains temporal consistency through:

1. **Wave Decay Function**: `activation(t) = base_activation * exp(-decay_rate * t)`
2. **Resonance Coupling**: Symbols with similar frequencies reinforce each other
3. **Memory Consolidation**: Patterns exceeding threshold become persistent
4. **Experience Streaming**: Continuous temporal flow of symbolic experiences

### Expert Module Architecture

The system integrates domain-specific knowledge through modular expert systems:

1. **Base Expert Interface**: Abstract class defining expert module protocol
2. **Logic Expert Module**: Specialized for logical reasoning operations  
3. **Math Expert Module**: Optimized for mathematical computations
4. **Expert Registry**: Dynamic management of available expert modules
5. **Synergy Calculation**: Weighted combination of expert recommendations
