# START_HERE.md â€“ Wave Engine in 60 Seconds ðŸš€

Welcome! This repo is the full research dump â€” successes, failures, experiments. If you just want to *see it work*, follow the steps below.

---
## TL;DR
```
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/midatlanticAI/atlandemo.git
cd atlandemo

# 2. 30-second demo (logic reasoning)
python simple_wave_showcase.py

# 3. Chat with it (CLI chatbot)
python wave_interactive_chatbot.py

# 4. Reproduce speed benchmark
python quick_logicbench_test.py      # results â†’ wave_vs_ollama_results.json
```
No extra dependencies, no GPU, runs on a toaster.

## What *is* Wave Engine?
â€¢ A 102 KB wave-interference reasoning core (file: `enhanced_wave_engine.py`).  
â€¢ Uses pure sin/cos math â€” **zero** neural networks or attention layers.  
â€¢ Deterministic, explainable, ~5 000Ã— faster than transformer LLMs in LogicBench tests.

## What it *is not* (yet)
â€¢ It does **not** load or fine-tune existing LLM weights.  
â€¢ It is **not** a production-ready ChatGPT replacement.  
â€¢ UX is CLI-only for now â€” contributions welcome!
