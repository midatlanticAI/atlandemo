SYMBOLIC MISCONCEPTION ANALYSIS
Showing how EdT misunderstands what "symbolic" means in Atlan Memory Core context

EdT's objection: "the whole symbolic thing wouldn't really work well for what I'm doing, 
where the actual language is important, the feeling, the emotion, and not just the data"

This reveals he's thinking of OLD symbolic AI, not Atlan's ENHANCED symbolic cognition.
