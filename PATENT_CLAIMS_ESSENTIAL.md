## CORE PATENTABLE INNOVATIONS

### 1. SYMBOL-TO-WAVE CONVERSION ALGORITHM
**Novel Method**: Converting symbolic inputs to deterministic wave patterns using hash-based mathematical formulas

**Specific Formula**:
```
frequency = 1.0 + (hash(symbol) % 100) / 100.0
amplitude = 0.5 + (length(symbol) % 10) / 20.0  
phase = (hash(symbol) % 628) / 100.0
wave_value = amplitude * sin(2π * frequency * time + phase)
```

### 2. WAVE INTERFERENCE REASONING ENGINE  
**Novel Method**: Performing logical operations through wave interference calculations instead of neural networks

**Interference Logic**:
- Constructive interference (phase_diff < π/4) → Logical agreement
- Destructive interference (phase_diff > 3π/4) → Logical conflict  
- Harmonic interference → Nuanced relationships

### 3. TEMPORAL COGNITION ARCHITECTURE
**Novel System**: Maintaining temporal consistency in reasoning through wave decay and resonance

**Key Components**:
- Wave decay: `activation(t) = base * exp(-decay_rate * t)`
- Resonance coupling between similar frequencies
- Memory consolidation through persistence thresholds
