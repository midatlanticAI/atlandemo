TECHNICAL INVENTION

Core Innovation: Symbol-to-Wave Conversion

Novel algorithm for converting symbols to deterministic wave patterns:

def symbol_to_wave(symbol, time):
    frequency = 1.0 + (hash(symbol) % 100) / 100.0
    amplitude = 0.5 + (len(symbol) % 10) / 20.0  
    phase = (hash(symbol) % 628) / 100.0
    return amplitude * sin(2*PI * frequency * time + phase)

Wave Interference Reasoning

Logical operations through wave interference:

def wave_interference(wave1, wave2):
    phase_diff = abs(wave1.phase - wave2.phase) % (2*PI)
    
    if phase_diff < PI/4:
        return wave1 + wave2      # Constructive (agreement)
    elif phase_diff > 3*PI/4:
        return abs(wave1 - wave2) # Destructive (conflict)
    else:
        return wave1 * wave2      # Harmonic (nuanced)

Temporal Cognition Architecture

Temporal consistency through wave decay:

def temporal_cognition(waves, time):
    for wave in waves:
        wave.activation *= exp(-decay_rate * time)
    return consolidated_memory(waves)

===============================================================================

DETAILED TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION

Symbol-to-Wave Conversion Algorithm:
The core innovation converts symbolic inputs into deterministic wave patterns using the following mathematical transformation:

For each symbol S:
- frequency(S) = 1.0 + (hash(S) % 100) / 100.0
- amplitude(S) = 0.5 + (length(S) % 10) / 20.0
- phase(S) = (hash(S) % 628) / 100.0
- wave_value(S,t) = amplitude(S) * sin(2*PI * frequency(S) * t + phase(S))

Where:
- hash(S) is a deterministic hash function applied to symbol S
- length(S) is the character length of symbol S
- t is the current time parameter
- PI represents the mathematical constant pi (3.14159...)

Wave Interference Calculation:
The system determines logical relationships through wave interference patterns:

For waves W1 and W2:
- phase_difference = |phase(W1) - phase(W2)| % (2*PI)
- If phase_difference < PI/4: interference = constructive (W1 + W2)
- Else if phase_difference > 3*PI/4: interference = destructive (|W1 - W2|)
- Else: interference = harmonic (W1 * W2)

Temporal Cognition Engine:
The system maintains temporal consistency through:
1. Wave Decay Function: activation(t) = base_activation * exp(-decay_rate * t)
2. Resonance Coupling: Symbols with similar frequencies reinforce each other
3. Memory Consolidation: Patterns exceeding threshold become persistent
4. Experience Streaming: Continuous temporal flow of symbolic experiences

===============================================================================
