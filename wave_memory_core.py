"""
Wave Memory Core
================

This module re-exports the original `memory_muse_perfect_solution` classes &
functions under a neutral name so users don't have to reference the old
"Memory Muse" moniker.

Nothing changes internally â€” it simply imports *all* public symbols from the
prior module so existing functionality continues to work without touching the
research code.
