### Mathematical Foundation

The core algorithm implements wave interference mathematics:

```python
# Wave Generation Algorithm
frequency = 1.0 + (hash(symbol) % 100) / 100.0
amplitude = 0.5 + (len(symbol) % 10) / 20.0
phase = (hash(symbol) % 628) / 100.0

# Wave Activation Calculation
wave_value = amplitude * sin(2π * frequency * time + phase)
```

#### Wave Interference Types:
1. **Constructive Resonance:** Waves reinforce (phase difference < π/4)
2. **Destructive Resonance:** Waves cancel (phase difference > 3π/4)
3. **Harmonic Resonance:** Waves create new frequency (similar frequencies)
