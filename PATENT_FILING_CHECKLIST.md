## üî• CRITICAL PATENT CLAIMS BEING PROTECTED

### Core Algorithm (Most Valuable)
```python
frequency = 1.0 + (hash(symbol) % 100) / 100.0
amplitude = 0.5 + (len(symbol) % 10) / 20.0  
phase = (hash(symbol) % 628) / 100.0
wave_value = amplitude * sin(2œÄ * frequency * time + phase)
```

### Performance Claims
- **3,068x faster** than LLaMA 3.2
- **12,400x smaller** memory footprint  
- **Sub-millisecond** processing times
- **Cross-platform consistency** across 7 languages

### Commercial Applications
- Edge computing and IoT devices
- Safety-critical systems requiring deterministic AI
- Real-time applications needing millisecond responses
- Enterprise systems requiring explainable AI
