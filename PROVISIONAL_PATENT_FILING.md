## TECHNICAL INVENTION

### Core Innovation: Symbol-to-Wave Conversion
```python
# Novel algorithm for converting symbols to deterministic wave patterns
def symbol_to_wave(symbol, time):
    frequency = 1.0 + (hash(symbol) % 100) / 100.0
    amplitude = 0.5 + (len(symbol) % 10) / 20.0  
    phase = (hash(symbol) % 628) / 100.0
    return amplitude * sin(2π * frequency * time + phase)
```

### Wave Interference Reasoning
```python
# Logical operations through wave interference
def wave_interference(wave1, wave2):
    phase_diff = abs(wave1.phase - wave2.phase) % (2π)
    
    if phase_diff < π/4:
        return wave1 + wave2      # Constructive (agreement)
    elif phase_diff > 3π/4:
        return abs(wave1 - wave2) # Destructive (conflict)
    else:
        return wave1 * wave2      # Harmonic (nuanced)
```

### Temporal Cognition Architecture
```python
# Temporal consistency through wave decay
def temporal_cognition(waves, time):
    for wave in waves:
        wave.activation *= exp(-decay_rate * time)
    return consolidated_memory(waves)
```
